# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Commerce and Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to improve my knowledge of programming and its application towards statistics
- I am interested in learning about how to apply statistics in a technologically creative way
